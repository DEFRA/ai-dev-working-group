# Contributing to the DEFRA AI Dev Working Group repository

Contributions are what keep this repository useful. GitHub Copilot moves quickly, development contexts change, and no small group of people can stay on top of everything on their own. If you have something worth sharing, whether that is a prompt that has saved you time, a tutorial you wish had existed when you started, or an honest account of testing a new feature, this is the right place for it.

The working group reviews and approves all pull requests, but that process is meant to be supportive rather than gatekeeping. The goal is to make sure content is accurate, clear, and genuinely useful to other DEFRA developers before it goes in.

## What you can contribute

This repository accepts several types of contribution, and all of them are equally valued.

**Markdown documentation** covers most of what is here: guidance, governance notes, ways of working, and reference material. If you are writing or updating a markdown file, aim for clarity over completeness. A well-written page that covers one thing well is more useful than a sprawling document that tries to cover everything.

**Code examples and scripts** should be practical and grounded in realistic DEFRA development contexts where possible. Include enough context that someone can understand what the example is demonstrating and why, not just copy and paste it. If a code example depends on a specific environment or configuration, say so clearly.

**Prompt library entries** should be prompts you have actually used and found to work consistently. Include the task type, the language or framework it applies to if relevant, the prompt itself, and a brief note on what it does well and where it has limitations. Prompts that have only been tested once or in a single narrow context are better raised as a discussion first.

**Tutorial walkthroughs** should be accurate at the time of writing and include a date so readers know when to treat them with scepticism. GitHub Copilot's behaviour and interface change regularly, and a tutorial that was correct six months ago may now be misleading. Write in plain steps, test each step before submitting, and avoid assuming a particular skill level in the reader unless the tutorial is explicitly aimed at one.

**Feature evaluation write-ups** are some of the most valuable content in this repository. When you write one, be honest. Document what you tested, how you tested it, what worked, what did not, and what you would want to know before relying on it in production. These write-ups are not marketing. They are technical notes from practitioners, and they are most useful when they are direct.

## How to contribute

There is no single required process. If you prefer to raise an issue first and discuss the contribution before writing anything, do that. If you would rather just open a pull request with something you have already written, that works too. If you want to talk something through informally before committing to either, the working group Slack channel or GitHub Discussions are both reasonable places to start.

What matters is that contributions go through a pull request before being merged. This gives the working group the opportunity to review the content, ask questions, and suggest changes before it becomes part of the shared guidance.

When you open a pull request, the description should give reviewers enough context to understand what you have added or changed and why. You do not need to write an essay, but a pull request with no description and no context is harder to review fairly and will take longer to merge.

## Content standards

The working group does not enforce a rigid house style, but there are a few things worth keeping in mind across all content types.

Write for the reader who does not already know what you know. It is easy to assume context that the person reading your contribution does not have. If something needs background to make sense, provide it briefly rather than assuming it.

Be factual and be specific. Vague guidance that could apply to any tool in any context is not very useful. Where you can, anchor what you are writing to real behaviour, real constraints, and real DEFRA context.

If something is untested or uncertain, say so. Content that presents speculation as established fact erodes trust in the whole repository. It is fine to note that something has not been fully evaluated yet, as long as that is clear to the reader.

Keep content current. If you are contributing a tutorial or feature write-up, include a review date. If you later notice that something you contributed has gone out of date, updating it is just as valuable a contribution as writing something new.

## Review and approval

The working group aims to review pull requests within a reasonable timeframe. If your pull request has not had any activity after a week or so, a nudge in the Slack channel or GitHub Discussions is entirely reasonable.

Reviews are a conversation, not a verdict. If a reviewer asks for changes, that is not a rejection. It is an attempt to make the contribution as useful as possible before it goes in. Equally, if you disagree with a review comment, say so. The working group does not expect contributors to accept every suggestion without question.

## A note on accuracy

Because this repository is used by DEFRA developers making real decisions about how they work, accuracy matters more than volume. It is better to have less content that people can rely on than more content they have to second-guess. If you are not sure whether something is accurate, check before submitting rather than adding a caveat and hoping for the best.

If you spot something in the repository that is inaccurate or out of date, raising an issue or opening a corrective pull request is one of the most useful things you can do, even if you did not write the original content.
