# DEFRA AI Dev Working Group

This repository is the central home for the DEFRA AI Dev Working Group. It exists to help DEFRA developers use AI coding tools well, starting with GitHub Copilot, through shared guidance, practical tutorials, tested prompts, and honest documentation of what works and what does not.

## About the working group

The DEFRA AI Dev Working Group started the way most useful things do: a small number of developers who were already using GitHub Copilot, had opinions about it, and wanted to compare notes. It was not set up by a programme board or handed down as an initiative. It grew because there was an obvious gap between what individual developers were discovering and what the wider DEFRA development community had access to.

The group is developer-led and open to any DEFRA developer who wants to be involved. There is no formal membership process. If you use GitHub Copilot, have something to contribute, or just want to follow along, you are welcome here.

### Mission

To help DEFRA developers get real, responsible value from GitHub Copilot by building a shared body of practical knowledge that reflects how we actually work.

That means being honest about limitations as well as strengths, keeping guidance grounded in DEFRA's technical context, and updating things when they go out of date rather than letting them drift.

### Goals

The working group has four broad goals that shape what we spend our time on.

The first is knowledge sharing. GitHub Copilot moves quickly. Features ship, behaviours change, and what worked well six months ago may not be the best approach today. The working group exists partly as a mechanism for DEFRA developers to share what they are learning with each other, rather than everyone having to work it out independently.

The second is feature evaluation. When GitHub releases something new, whether that is a new model, a new IDE capability, or an update to agent mode, the working group tests it in realistic DEFRA development contexts and documents what it actually does. The goal is to give developers an honest account of whether something is worth their time, not a summary of the release notes.

The third is ways of working. GitHub Copilot raises real questions about code review, about what responsible use looks like, and about how teams should handle AI-assisted output. The working group develops practical norms for these questions, informed by what teams are actually experiencing rather than what looks good on paper.

The fourth is influencing tooling strategy. Because the group sits close to day-to-day development work, it is well placed to inform decisions about AI tooling procurement, licensing, and policy within DEFRA. That is not the primary purpose of the group, but it is a useful consequence of the work.

## Who this is for

This repository is for all DEFRA developers, regardless of experience level or how much you have used AI tooling before. Whether you are just getting started with GitHub Copilot, trying to get more out of it, or leading a team through adoption, there is something here for you.

## Getting involved

Working group meetings are open to any DEFRA developer and are held regularly to review new GitHub Copilot features, share findings, and agree on content updates. You do not need to attend meetings to contribute, as pull requests and GitHub Discussions are equally valid ways to participate.

If you want to join, contribute content, or raise a question, you can do so through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/defra/ai-dev-working-group/discussions) or by opening a pull request directly. Before contributing content, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), which covers the content standards, review process, and how to submit changes.

## Staying current

GitHub releases GitHub Copilot updates frequently, and guidance can go out of date. Each document in this repository carries a review date. If you notice something that is no longer accurate, raising an issue or opening a pull request is the most useful thing you can do. You can watch this repository on GitHub to receive notifications when content is updated.
